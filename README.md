# Palindrome Checker Webpage

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/72c01cc5-c119-4c6b-9860-ff9a78b212d5/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/palindrome-checker-webpage/deploys)

This is a Palindrome Checker Webpage, inspired by my first certification project from freeCodeCamp and the layout design from CodingNepal. The main improvement in this version is the use of ternary operators in JavaScript for better performance, replacing the if...else statements used in the original project.

## Overview

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing). This webpage allows users to check if their input is a palindrome.

## Features

- **User Input**: Enter any text to check for palindrome properties.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate results on whether the input is a palindrome.
- **Text Sanitization**: Automatically removes non-alphanumeric characters and adjusts text casing for accurate checking.
- **Interactive Design**: Simple and responsive user interface inspired by CodingNepal.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the palindrome checking logic and interactivity using ternary operators for better performance.
